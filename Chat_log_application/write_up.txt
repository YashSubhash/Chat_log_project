Project Name : Chatlog

1. The chatlog which we created is having a single server where multiple users can add their data (by adding the message in message section).


2. The following modules should be installed to work with this application

   express, bodyparser, http, socket.io, mongoose


3. And below are the some commands to install those modules in our vs code
  -->> npm install nodejs

  -->> npm install express

  -->> npm install bodyparser

  -->> npm install http

  -->> npm install socket.io

  -->> npm install mongoose

  -->> node server.js // (to connect with the server)
 
4.When a user connect to the server (localhost:3000)and adds some message in the message section that particular message will display in the same page

5.And the same message will get stored in the collection which we have used

 --> databse used -->> (chat)

 --> collection used -->> (messages)
6. In this way the message will gets stored in the database.

7. when an another user connect to the same server(same portal) then that user can also see the recent data(message) which is stored already by other users.

8.In that way muktiple user can able to send the name and message to the grop chat application ,that will be able to view all user.
9.Also user able to view how many user to connected to the server.
